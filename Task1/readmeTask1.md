# Task 1 
# MainCrafts Landing Page

A modern, responsive landing page built as part of my Full Stack Web Development Internship Task 1 at MainCrafts.

This page is designed to represent a startup or product launch and includes a header with dropdown navigation, a hero section with a call-to-action, a feature grid, and a footer. It’s fully responsive and works on desktop, tablet and mobile.

## Features

- **Header with dropdown navigation**  
  Logo/brand + menu items. On mobile the menu turns into a toggle (hamburger) button.

- **Hero section**  
  Large headline, tagline and two call-to-action buttons with a background image/gradient.

- **Features grid**  
  Four feature cards (“Fast”, “Responsive”, “Scalable”, “Secure”) using Font Awesome icons.

- **Footer**  
  Copyright text with links for Privacy Policy, Terms and Contact.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 (Flexbox & Grid) for layout and responsiveness
- Google Fonts for typography
- Font Awesome for icons
- Unsplash image for hero background
- A small JavaScript snippet for the mobile menu toggle and scroll animations
